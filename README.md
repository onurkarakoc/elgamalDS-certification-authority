# elgamalDS-certification-authority
Alice and Bob want to start a secret and authenticated communication. That's why we are creating certificates in the
certification authority (CA). CA will send certificates using elgamal digital signature algorithm. After Alice and
Bob have own certificate, they will exhange them. Then, they will communicate using elgamal digital signature algorithm 
and advanced encrytpion algorithm. In order to use symmetric key, they will create and exchange their keys using Diffie-Hellman
key exhange algorithm.
